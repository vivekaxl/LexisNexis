In the above:

+ _m_ is some model that generates candidate
  solutions that we wish to niche.
+ _(west,east)_ are not _the_ most distant points
  (that would require _N*N) distance
  calculations). But they are at least very distant
  to each other.

This code needs some helper functions. _Dist_ uses
the standard Euclidean measure. Note that you tune
what it uses to define the niches (decisions or
objectives) using the _what_ parameter:

"""

## WHERE2 = Recursive Fastmap


WHERE2 finds everyone's else's distance from the poles
  and divide the data on the mean point of those
  distances.  This all stops if:

+  Any division has _tooFew_ solutions (say,
  less than _sqrt_ of the total number of
  solutions).
+ Something has gone horribly wrong and you are
  recursing _tooDeep_

This code is controlled by the options in [_The_ settings](settingspy).  For
example, if _The.pruning_ is true, we may ignore
some sub-tree (this process is discussed, later on).
Also, if _The.verbose_ is true, the _show_
function prints out a little tree showing the
progress (and to print indents in that tree, we use
the string _The.b4_).  For example, here's WHERE2
dividing 93 examples from NASA93.

## An Experimental Extensions

Lately I've been experimenting with a system that
prunes as it divides the data. GALE checks for
domination between the poles and ignores data in
halves with a dominated pole. This means that for
_N_ solutions we only ever have to evaluate
_2*log(N)_ of them- which is useful if each
evaluation takes a long time.  

The niches found in this way
contain non-dominated poles; i.e. they are
approximations to the Pareto frontier.
Preliminary results show that this is a useful
approach but you should treat those results with a
grain of salt.

In any case, this code supports that pruning as an
optional extra (and is enabled using the
_slots.pruning_ flag). In summary, this code says if
the scores for the poles are more different that
_slots.wriggle_ and one pole has a better score than
the other, then ignore the other pole.

"""
def maybePrune(m,lvl,west,east):
  "Usually, go left then right, unless dominated."
  goLeft, goRight = True,True # default
  if  The.prune and lvl >= The.what.depthMin:
    sw = scores(m, west)
    se = scores(m, east)
    if abs(sw - se) > The.wriggle: # big enough to consider
      if se > sw: goLeft   = False   # no left
      if sw > se: goRight  = False   # no right
  return goLeft, goRight
"""

Note that I do not allow pruning until we have
descended at least _slots.depthMin_ into the tree.

### Model-specific Stuff

WHERE2 talks to models via the the following model-specific variables:

+ _m.cols_: list of indices in a list
+ _m.names_: a list of names for each column.
+ _m.decisions_: the subset of cols relating to decisions.
+ _m.obectives_: the subset of cols relating to objectives.
+ _m.eval(m,eg)_: function for computing variables from _eg_.
+ _m.lo[c]_ : the lowest value in column _c_.
+ _m.hi[c]_ : the highest value in column _c_.
+ _m.w[c]_: the weight for each column. Usually equal to one. 
  If an objective and if we are minimizing  that objective, then the weight is negative.


### Model-general stuff

Using the model-specific stuff, WHERE2 defines some
useful general functions.

"""

  "with variable x of model m, pick one value at random"

      val = it.cells[c]
